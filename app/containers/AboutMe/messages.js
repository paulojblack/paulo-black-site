        I'm Paulo, and this page mostly exists because I needed enough links on the
        home page to justify having a horizontal bar style menu. If you're interested
        enough to read anything here you should really just get in touch with me, it's
        more fun. But I guess it's fun to just read what a person has to say without
        dealing with actually talking to them too so maybe I can put some stuff here.

        I like to write in a very stream of consciousness style and I'll usually write
        a whole bunch quickly, pausing if I come across a phrase I feel might have some promise,
        and barely ever edit unless I really want you to hire me or something. This is probably
        a significant contributing factor to why I have never tried to pursue a non-technical career;
        you can't write an academic paper if you preface large portions of what you say with "like",
        "fucking", and "idk maybe". The audiences for technical software documentation tend to receive
        profanity, verbosity, and incoherence with much more grace than those high fallutin' philologists
        trolling for primary sources of the Second Children's Crusade on JSTOR at 2am.

        That said, I have unnecessarily strong opinions (which I am both unqualified to hold
        and always prepared to offer without solicitation) on contemporary cultural perspectives
        that I see as being foolishly critical of the quality of writing or literacy in general,
        what constitutes "good writing" and the relationship that has with social
        self examination as regards intelligence or the status of our culture as a whole.
        I've decided this very second to not bother expounding on them here, but
        rather let this paragraph sort of dissipate inconclusively to serve as a demonstration of the
        description I gave of my writing style in the previous paragraph.

        At the moment I'm nominally a Full Stack Developer, but to be frank the contents of this site are
        by far the most elaborate front end work I've ever done. I am far more interested in back end work
        and I like working on systems architecture, automation, and infrastructure when I'm not busy
        API droning and writing ridiculously over-architected pagination algorithms. I have a degree
        in physics I paid a nonsensical amount for, ostensibly investing in my own future, upon completion
        of which I spent a half year or so teaching myself programming because I didn't want to spend twelve
        years convincing myself I could be the next Paul(o) Dirac while Postdocing my way out of debt.
        Fortunately, as it turns out, I like futzing with computer a lot more than spending a day writing
        a Lagrangian that spits out the normal modes of fourteen pendulums attached to springs that hold
        some symbolic meaning I'll never be drunk enough to understand.

        Why you're still here beats me, but we can run through some more stuff for the sake of
        completeness. Like I said, got the physics degree, love rock climbing, philosophy, reading,
        writing, music, psychology. I really just love learning in general, which I understand is a banal
        thing to assert about yourself, but you're taking everything else I say on faith so who cares.
        I attribute the majority of any success of mine to this trait, the origin of which I believe
        to be a combination of social privilege, necessary adaptation to certain elements of my childhood,
        and the general good fortune I have in possessing a number of characteristics that lend themselves to
        being happy. I value humor, cheerful dispositions, and social harmony very highly and though I
        thoroughly love people who challenge me intellectually, I find myself less attracted to even the
        most interesting people if they are too serious, mean, or competitive.

        I'm beginning to run out of things I feel are worth saying. I often hit this point
        when I embark on some exploratory bit of writing like this, and I know I've hit it
        when I start writing a paragraph, rewriting it, changing its topic halfway through,
        and still feeling like I don't really have anything worth saying. So I'll just trail
        off here, possibly returning to add or maybe rewrite this whole thing, but maybe not.
        I wonder if the "you" I've been addressing this to will ever exist. I suspect not, but
        I am constantly surprised at the unpredictability of what other people are interested in.
        If you are "you", you really ought to just click the mail icon on the home page and get
        in touch, I don't see why you'd waste all this time reading some guy talk
        about nothing and then not bother saying hi.
